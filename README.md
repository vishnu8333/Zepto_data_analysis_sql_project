# Zepto_data_analysis_sql_project
 📌 Project Overview
 
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more


📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

name: Product name as it appears on the app

category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

weightInGms: Product weight in grams

outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

🔧 Project Workflow

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation

We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

2. Data Import

Loaded CSV file
Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

3. 🔍 Data Exploration

--Counted the total number of records in the dataset

--Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

--Checked for null values across all columns

--Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

--Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

--Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
   
--Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

--Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

5. 📊 Business Insights
   
--Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

--Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

--Estimated potential revenue for each product category

--Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

--Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

--Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

--Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

--Measured total inventory weight per product category
